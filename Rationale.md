# Design Rationale

This document collects context and reasoning behind design decisions in
WebAssembly.

## Why AST?

Why not a stack-, register- or SSA-based bytecode?
* Trees allow a smaller binary encoding: [JSZap][], [Slim Binaries][].
* [Polyfill prototype][] shows simple and efficient translation to asm.js.

## Basic Types Only

WebAssembly only represents [a few types](AstSemantics.md#Types).

* More complex types can be formed from these basic types. It's up to the source
  language compiler to express its own types in terms of the basic machine
  types. This allows WebAssembly to present itself as a virtual ISA, and lets
  compilers target it as they would any other ISA.
* These types are efficiently executed by all modern architectures.
* Smaller types (such as `i8` and `i16`) are usually no more efficient and in
  languages like C/C++ are only semantically meaningful for memory accesses
  since arithmetic get widened to `i32` or `i64`. Avoiding them at least for MVP
  makes it easier to implement a WebAssembly VM.
* Other types (such as `f16`, `i128`) aren't widely supported by existing
  hardware and can be supported by runtime libraries if developers wish to use
  them. Hardware support is sometimes uneven, e.g. some support load/store of
  `f16` only whereas other hardware also supports scalar arithmetic on `f16`,
  and yet other hardware only supports SIMD arithmetic on `f16`. They can be
  added to WebAssembly later without compromising MVP.
* More complex object types aren't semantically useful for MVP: WebAssembly
  seeks to provide the primitive building blocks upon which higher-level
  constructs can be built. They may become useful to support other languages,
  especially when considering [garbage collection](GC.md).


## Load/Store Addressing

Load/store instructions include an immediate offset used for
[addressing](AstSemantics.md#Addressing). This is intended to simplify folding
of offsets into complex address modes in hardware, and to simplify bounds
checking optimizations. It offloads some of the optimization work to the
compiler that targets WebAssembly, executing on the developer's machine, instead
of performing that work in the WebAssembly compiler on the user's machine.


## Alignment Hints

Load/store instructions contain
[alignment hints](AstSemantics.md#Alignment). This makes it easier to generate
efficient code on certain hardware architectures.

Either tooling or an explicit opt-in "debug mode" in the spec could allow
execution of a module in a mode that threw exceptions on misaligned access.
This mode would incur some runtime cost for branching on most platforms which is
why it isn't the specified default.


## Out of Bounds

The ideal semantics is for
[out-of-bounds accesses](AstSemantics.md#Out-of-Bounds) to trap, but the
implications are not yet fully clear.

There are several possible variations on this design being discussed and
experimented with. More measurement is required to understand the associated
tradeoffs.

  * After an out-of-bounds access, the instance can no longer execute code and
    any outstanding JavaScript [ArrayBuffer][] aliasing the linear memory are
    detached.
    * This would primarily allow hoisting bounds checks above effectful
      operations.
    * This can be viewed as a mild security measure under the assumption that
      while the sandbox is still ensuring safety, the instance's internal state
      is incoherent and further execution could lead to Bad Things (e.g., XSS
      attacks).
  * To allow for potentially more-efficient memory sandboxing, the semantics
    could allow for a nondeterministic choice between one of the following when
    an out-of-bounds access occurred.
    * The ideal trap semantics.
    * Loads return an unspecified value.
    * Stores are either ignored or store to an unspecified location in the
      linear memory.
    * Either tooling or an explicit opt-in "debug mode" in the spec should allow
      execution of a module in a mode that threw exceptions on out-of-bounds
      access.

## Resizing

Implementations provide a `page_size` operation which allows them to efficiently
map the underlying OS's capabilities to the WebAssembly application, as well as
to communicate their own implementation details in a useful manner to the
developer.


## Control Flow

See [#299](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/299).


## Locals

C/C++ makes it possible to take the address of a function's local values and
pass this pointer to callees or to other threads. Since WebAssembly's local
variables are outside the address space, C/C++ compilers implement address-taken
variables by creating a separate stack data structure within linear memory. This
stack is sometimes called the "aliased" stack, since it is used for variables
which may be pointed to by pointers.

This prevents WebAssembly from performing clever optimizations on the stack and
liveness of such variables, but this loss isn't expected to be
consequential. Common C compiler optimizations such as LLVM's global value
numbering effectively split address-taken variables into parts, shrinking the
range where they actually need to have their address taken, and creating new
ranges where they can be allocated as local variables.

Conversely, non-address taken values which are usually on the stack are instead
represented as locals inside functions. This effectively means that WebAssembly
has an infinite set of registers, and can choose to spill values as it sees fit
in a manner unobservable to the hosted code. This implies that there's a
separate stack, unaddressable from hosted code, which is also used to spill
return values. This allows strong security properties to be enforced, but does
mean that two stacks are maintained (one by the VM, the other by the compiler
which targets WebAssembly) which can lead to some inefficiencies.

Local variables are not in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, meaning that
multiple incoming SSA values which have separate liveness can "share" the
storage represented by a local through the `set_local` operation. From an SSA
perspective, this means that multiple independent values can share a local
variable in WebAssembly, which is effectively a kind of pre-coloring that clever
producers can use to pre-color variables and give hints to a WebAssembly VM's
register allocation algorithms, offloading some of the optimization work from
the WebAssembly VM.


## Variable-Length Argument Lists

C and C++ compilers are expected to implement variable-length argument lists by
storing arguments in a buffer in linear memory and passing a pointer to the
buffer. This greatly simplifies WebAssembly VM implementations by punting this
ABI consideration to the front-end compiler. It does negatively impact
performance, but variable-length calls are already somewhat slow.


## Multiple Return Values

TODO


## Indirect Calls

The exact semantics of indirect function calls, function pointers, and what
happens when calling the wrong function, are still being discussed.

Fundamentally linear memory is a simple collection of bytes, which means that
some integral representation of function pointers must exist. It's desirable to
hide the actual address of generated code from untrusted code because that would
be an unfortunate information leak which could have negative security
implications. Indirection is therefore desired.

One extra concern is that existing C++ code sometimes stores data inside of what
is usually a function pointer. This is expected to keep working.

Dynamic linking further complicates this: WebAssembly cannot simply standardize
on fixed-size function tables since dynamically linked code can add new
functions, as well as remove them.


## Expressions with Control Flow

Expression trees offer significant size reduction by avoiding the need for
`set_local`/`get_local` pairs in the common case of an expression with only one,
immediate use. The `comma` and `conditional` primitives provide AST nodes that
express control flow and thus allow more opportunities to build bigger
expression trees and further reduce `set_local`/`get_local` usage (which
constitute 30-40% of total bytes in the
[polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill-prototype-1)).
Additionally, these primitives are useful building blocks for
WebAssembly-generators (including the JavaScript polyfill prototype).


## Limited Local Nondeterminism

There are a few obvious cases where nondeterminism is essential to the API, such
as random number generators, date/time functions or input events. The
WebAssembly specification is strict when it comes to other sources of
[limited local nondeterminism](Nondeterminism.md) of operations: it specifies
all possible corner cases, and specifies a single outcome when this can be done
reasonably.

Ideally, WebAssembly would be fully deterministic because a fully deterministic
platform is easier to:

* Reason about.
* Implement.
* Test portably.

Nondeterminism is only specified as a compromise when there is no other
practical way to:

* Achieve [portable](Portability.md) native performance.
* Lower resource usage.
* Reduce implementation complexity (both of WebAssembly VMs as well as compilers
  generating WebAssembly binaries).
* Allow usage of new hardware features.
* Allows implementations to security-harden certain usecases.

When nondeterminism is allowed into WebAssembly it is always done in a limited
and local manner. This prevents the entire program from being invalid, as would
be the case with C++ undefined behavior.

As WebAssembly gets implemented and tested with multiple languages on multiple
architectures there may be a need to revisit some of the decisions:

* When all relevant hardware implement features the same way then there's no
  need to add nondeterminism to WebAssembly when realistically there's only one
  mapping from WebAssenbly expression to ISA-specific operations. One such
  example is floating-point: at a high-level most basic instructions follow
  IEEE-754 semantics, it is therefore not necessary to specify WebAssembly's
  floating-point operations differently from IEEE-754.
* When different languages have different expectations then it's unfortunate if
  WebAssembly measurably penalizes one's performance by enforcing determinism
  which that language doesn't care about, but which another language may want.
